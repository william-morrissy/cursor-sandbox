## 🎤 Key Talk Tracks (Memorize These)

**Opening:**
> "Cursor isn't just faster coding - it's faster feature delivery, with security and team knowledge built in."

**Multi-Agent:**
> "Copilot works on one file. Cursor works across your entire stack."

**.cursor Files:**
> "Your institutional knowledge, version-controlled and shared with every developer."

**Multiple Options:**
> "This is like pair programming with a senior engineer who shows you trade-offs."

**Closing:**
> "GitHub Copilot is an autocomplete tool. Cursor is a development environment."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Don't go over time on Feature 1 (max 3 minutes!)
- ❌ Don't let chat responses run too long (interrupt if needed)
- ❌ Don't skip the time checks
- ❌ Don't forget to show the `.cursor` directory structure
- ❌ Don't undersell the security review capabilities

## 🔄 Reset Command

```bash
./reset-demo.sh
```

Run this **before every demo** to ensure clean state.

## 💡 If Something Goes Wrong

**Chat is slow:**
> "While this loads, let me explain what Cursor is doing behind the scenes..."

**Wrong code generated:**
> "Great example - you can reject this and ask for a different approach. Let me show you..."

**Feature doesn't work:**
> "Let me show you this other feature instead, which is actually more relevant to [their use case]..."

**Running over time:**
> "I see we're at [X] minutes. Let me jump to the wrap-up so we respect your time..."

---

## 🎯 Call to Action (Memorize)

> "What I'd love to do is set you up with a trial for your team. The real proof is seeing how Cursor works with your actual codebase. Can we schedule 30 minutes next week where I help you configure Cursor for your team's specific needs?"

**Alternative CTA:**
> "I can set up a dedicated session with your engineering team to show how Cursor integrates with [their specific stack]. What does your calendar look like this week?"
